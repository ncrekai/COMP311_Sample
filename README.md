### Practice repository for GitHub workflow assignment

I wish I could be handing this in more complete
- I lost track of the order I should be completing the changes to the repository almost immediately. WIth GitHub tracking every change I couldn't go back and make corrections without further adding to the misteps outside of scrapping everything and starting over (or using more advanced GitHub reseting operations, which seemed inadvisable) - so I opted to keep continue adding  commits, pull requests, review/comments and merges, and hope that even out of order I have demonstrated understandind
- I made my simple application using java, but forgot I'd need to make it using a build tool like Maven/Gradle to create the release in GitHub. I just didn't have time to start over.
- One reason I don't have time is I spent a lot of it trying to grasp using the local git hooks - I was able to implement a simple Pre-Commit hook - but could not find sufficient documentation to explain using the pre-commit-msg / commit-msg hook I would need to enforce commit message conventions
