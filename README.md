### Practice repository for GitHub workflow assignment

_(Thank you for not making us submit a bunch of screen grabs of us completing each step)_

Hey Ace! - So, keeping track of fake branch updates is harder than I expected. As soon as I started the assignment I immediately starting getting the steps listed in the instructions out of order. And, since GitHub is all about keep track of the changes you make, the only way I could remove those misteps was to restart entirely (or employ complex reseting GitHub operations that would hardly be considered good practice)... So instead I've just decided to embrace the assignment in spirit, adding many commits, pull requests, review/comments and merges, but in no particular order.
